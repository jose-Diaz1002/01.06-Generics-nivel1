1.6-Gen√®rics-Level1   (review: Inga)

üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

This project consists of implementing two exercises to understand generic and non-generic methods in Java.

Exercise 1

Create a class named NoGenericMethods that stores three arguments of the same type, along with methods to 
store and retrieve these objects, and a constructor to initialize all three. Ensure that the arguments 
can be placed in any position when calling the constructor.

Exercise 2

Create a class named Persona with the attributes name, surname, and age. Then, create a class named 
GenericMethods with a generic method that accepts three arguments of a generic type. This method 
should simply print the received arguments to the console.

In the main() method of the main class, call the generic method with different types of parameters, such as:

An object of the Persona class

A String

A primitive data type

This will confirm that the method can accept any type of parameter in any order.
